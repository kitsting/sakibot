## Saki Bot
This bot is based on the 80s Japanese TV Show *Sukeban Deka*, and is meant to serve as a compliment to a Sukeban Deka-themed discord server.

### Setup:

If you want to use the bot for some reason, make a file called `.env` in the bot's directory. That file can have the following parameters:

`TOKEN = "Your token"` - Replace this with a valid bot token

To use the `/clip` command, be sure to populate the `/clips` folder with `.mp4` files.

### Currently available commands:

`/clip [clipname]` - send a clip from the `clips` folder. If no clipname is given, the bot will choose one at random.
